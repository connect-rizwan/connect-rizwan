# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Rizwan Ali

> A pixel pusher and server whisperer. Creating delightful user experiences with Flutter and powering them with Node.js.

## ðŸš€ What I Do

I'm a full-stack developer who loves crafting beautiful user experiences and robust backend systems. My code turns coffee into user smiles, one commit at a time.

### ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Magic
```dart
// I speak Flutter fluently
class MySkills extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<String> skills = [
    "Flutter UI/UX",
    "Custom Animations",
    "State Management",
    "Cross-Platform Development"
  ];
}
```

### âš¡ Backend Powers
```javascript
// Node.js is my trusty sidekick
const backendExpertise = {
  languages: ['Node.js', 'JavaScript', 'TypeScript'],
  databases: ['MongoDB', 'PostgreSQL'],
  apis: ['RESTful', 'GraphQL'],
  tools: ['Docker', 'Git', 'CI/CD']
};
```
